## README Classification Project

The Classification project is looking at the Telco Churn dataset. We will be attempting to answer several questions surrounding the likelihood of customer churn based on factors including type of internet service and tenure.

### Prerequisites

The code was written in Python 3.7.3 and you will need to have pandas, numpy, matplotlib,seaborn, and sklearn installed. Additionally, you will need access to the Telco dataset which can be found at the following link:

### Installation

You will need the following Python files from the repository to run the project: acquire.py, prep.py, split_scale.py, exploration.py, feature_selection.py, model.py, and model_final.ipynb

### Running the model

The model_final.ipynb file will run cell by cell to show the entire DS pipeline including analysis, visuals, and relevant statistical information. There is an additional presentation file with plain english conclusions derived from our analysis.
