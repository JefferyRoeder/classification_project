### Goal:

Accurately capture if a customer will churn based on their current tenure, internet/phone service, and other key metrics.

### Basic workflow:

We will quickly acquire the needed data, split the train and test data, quickly explore possibly key features, measure current churn rate, and visualize the findings. After initial exploration and findings we will continue to explore possible drivers of churn and look to improve on the initial findings. 


### Initial Hypotheses:

We believe that (short) tenure is a strong driver of churn. We will look to see if that is the main cause of churn for our telecomm customers.
