### Goal:

Accurately capture if a customer will churn based on their current tenure, internet/phone service, and other key metrics.

### Basic workflow:

We will quickly acquire the needed data, split the train and test data, quickly explore possibly key features, measure current churn rate, and visualize the findings. After initial exploration and findings we will continue to explore possible drivers of churn and look to improve on the initial findings. 


### Initial Hypotheses:

We believe that (short) tenure is a strong driver of churn. We will look to see if that is the main cause of churn for our telecomm customers.

### Initial Questions:

1. Could the month in which they signed up influence churn? i.e. if a cohort is identified by tenure, is there a cohort or cohorts who have a higher rate of churn than other cohorts? (Plot the rate of churn on a line chart where x is the tenure and y is the rate of churn (customers churned/total customers))

2. Are there features that indicate a higher propensity to churn? like type of internet service, type of phone service, online security and backup, senior citizens, paying more than x% of customers with the same services, etc.?

3. Is there a price threshold for specific services where the likelihood of churn increases once price for those services goes past that point? If so, what is that point for what service(s)?

4. If we looked at churn rate for month-to-month customers after the 12th month and that of 1-year contract customers after the 12th month, are those rates comparable?
